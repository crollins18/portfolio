During the Fall 2020 Semester, I participated in undergraduate indepedent development with Dr. Laurie Williams in the Department of Computer Science. Along with two other students, I helped design and develop two web portals with the aim of educating the general public about ways to protect themselves in the digital era. From spotting online scams to using a VPN, one of the sites is made for common cybersecurity best practices while the other site is focused on intimate partner violence.

Looking back on my experience working on this project, the biggest takeaway was learning how to concisely and clearly communicate often very technical topics in a manner that everyday digital citizens can easily understand. From crafting PowerPoint presentations to PowToon videos, the entire process of taking online research and pairing it down to the essentials helped hone my overall understanding of these topics I only had a general understanding about before. Working with other students on this project allowed me to become more experienced with effectively collaborating inorder to achieve a collective goal. Finally, having real life experience using Jekyll static site builder further solidified my confidence editing pages, styling, and other page assets.
